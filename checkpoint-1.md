## What is the name of your project?
DBTune Classical

## Please describe in short sentences the topic of your work.

The topic of our work is the classical music data. The goal of the project is to design and implement a web application that relies on the [RDF DBTune classical dataset](https://old.datahub.io/dataset/dbtune-classical).

## What was the main motivation to select this topic?

We chose this topic because some of us are interested in classical music and it was relatively easy to find an RDF dataset with information regarding this subject.

## Which data and knowledge sources did you already identified to be used in this project?

For the moment we found a dataset (http://dbtune.org/classical/) representing a collection of knowledge regarding western classical music. It was aggregated by Chris Cannam at Queen Mary University of London and provides inter-linking to the respective resources in other knowledge graphs, namely DBpedia and BBCMusic.

## Which main obstacules to the development of the project did you already identify?

The main obstacle will be the lack of experience in this field and the technologies that are commonly used in this environment.

## Please describe shortly the development phases and planning for the project.
